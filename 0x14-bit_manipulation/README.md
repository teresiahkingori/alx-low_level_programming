0x14. C - Bit manipulation
Computers represent all data internally as sequences of
bits.
Each bit can assume the value 0 or the value 1.
The bitwise operators are used to manipulate the bits of
integral operands both signed and unsigned.
Unsigned integers are normally used with the bitwise
operators.
Bitwise manipulations are machine dependent.
